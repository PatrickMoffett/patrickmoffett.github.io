<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Team & Tools</h3>
<p>
Cerulean Defenders is a game I am solo developing using Unreal Engine. I used a mix of both C++ and Blueprint for this project.
</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>
Cerulean Defenders is a Multiplayer Rogue-Lite. Concept is akin to Heroes of Hammerwatch and Gunfire Reborn. 
</p>


<h2>Experience</h2>
<p> Below is a list of major elements I worked with and programmed during development of this game.
<h3>Programming Elements I handled</h3> 
<ul>
<li><b>Animations:</b> Setup all animations in Unreal including blends, montages, anim slots, and animation graphs</li>
<li><b>Enemy AI:</b> Created enemy behaviors using Unreal's Blackboards </li>
<li><b>Online Subsystem:</b> Worked with Unreal's OnlineSubsystem to setup multiplayer lobbies, as well as steam multiplayer features.</li>
<li><b>Items:</b>: Created a Subsystem to manage spawning items from a datatable for players to ensure that players don't receive duplicate items during a run.</li>
<li><b>Save Subsystem:</b>: Created a subsystem to manage saving and loading the player's characters.</li>
<li><b>Gameplay Ability System:</b> Utilized the gameplay ability system plugin to create the combat system.</li>
<li><b>Replication and RPCs:</b> Utilized Unreal's replications and RPCs to create multiplayer functionality</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
This project is currently unfinished. In the future I plan to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Create more enemies, and better enemy AI</li>
<li>Create boss fights</li>
<li>Create more items and abilities</li>
<li>Fully implement experience and character levels (Framework already in place).</li>
<li>Fully implement lobby area including creating vendors to sell players upgrades to their character</li>
<li>Improve UI elements with art assets</li>
<li>and hopefully much more.</li>
</ul>
