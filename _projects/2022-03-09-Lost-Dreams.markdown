<h2>My Responsibilities</h2>
<p> Mony acted as our lead programmer, and Niki as our Lead Designer. I worked as a programmer to implement the design of the game
<h3>Programming Elements I handled</h3> 
<ul>
<li><b>Combat:</b> Created the attack functionality for the player and all the monsters</li>
<li><b>Enemy Navigation:</b> Utilized Astar package to create Enemy Navigation </li>
<li><b>Enemy AI:</b> Created enemy behaviors </li>
<li><b>Enemy Spawners:</b> Created spawners that could be placed into the level to spawn enemies. Utilized gizmos to give appropriate information to designers on where enemies would spawn.</li>
<li><b>Boss Fight:</b>: Wrote a script for a modular boss fight that could have different types of enemies spawn between rounds of fighting the boss.</li>
<li><b>Music:</b>: Created the Background Music Manager to play the music, and allow dynamic switching of songs for different scenes and events</li>
<li><b>SFX:</b> Implemented all of the SFX for the game</li>
<li><b>Sound Manager:</b> Created a Sound Manager to allow adjusting the volume of the music and the SFX from the menu.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
I hope to return to this project and add some finishing touches that we didn't have time for during the jam, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the combat further</li>
<li>Clear up some space in the levels to allow more room for the enemies to navigate</li>
<li>Fix some of the small bugs that made it into the game</li>
</ul>
